But the mere fact that cue-overload effects sometimes play a role does not mean that the role is a substantial one.

In addition, my model is consistent with the relatively small effects reported by Fernández-Villaverde et al.

Work by Denes, Eggertsson, and Gilbukh (2012) shows that the form of a fiscal consolidation can determine the effectiveness of changes in fiscal policy when the ZLB binds.	result

Credence is lent to this hypothesis by research that has concluded that evolutionary changes have been experienced by introduced Chinook salmon populations over a 90-year period in New Zealand.

Drawing upon interviews with academics, Lee (2003) proposes a model of three concentric zones of information that surround a user: “immediate,” within arm’s reach or a few footsteps away; “adjacent,” such as a nearby university library; and “outside,” such as a more distant bookstore. Speaking largely from an objectifying stance and adopting Lee’s concept of the “immediate information space,” this paper focuses on a visual research method—photography— that seems particularly well suited to learning more about settings and their accompanying information phenomena. A variety of investigative approaches may be used to study immediate information space. Jones (2007) suggests ethnography combined with design methodologies, and places emphasis on context and situation, including contextual inquiry (Beyer & Holtzblatt, 1998), situated activity (Suchman, 1983), and situated design (Greenbaum & Kyng, 1991). Naumer and Fisher (2007) recommend naturalistic inquiry (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) and the data-gathering methods of unobtrusive observation, interviews, diaries, text analysis, pictures, and videos. Sandstrom and Sandstrom (1995) champion scientific ethnography, which sanctions both quantitative and qualitative data-gathering techniques, and carefully negotiates the views of the researcher and informant, distinguished as “etic” or “emic” perspectives.	background

The extirpation of ground squirrels from the boreal forest (Gillis et al. 2005; Donker and Krebs 2011), poor active-season survival, low recruitment rates, immigration from nearby low elevation-meadow habitat and population growth rates <1.0 provide convincing evidence that the boreal forest functions as a sink habitat for arctic ground squirrels. Conversely, arctic ground squirrel populations in nearby low elevation-meadow habitat appear to be stable and self-sustaining and appear to function as sources for populations in the boreal forest. Juveniles in the present study moved from low elevationmeadow habitat into boreal forest habitat, which suggests that low-elevation meadows have the capacity to support a nearby population sink. These findings also validate Gillis et al.’s (2005) suggestion that boreal forest populations are functioning as population sinks and that nearby meadow habitats may provide the immigrants required to sustain arctic ground squirrel populations in the forest.	background
